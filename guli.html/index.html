<h2> Chapter1 </h2> 
<h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
<p >Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:<u>once or twice </u> she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and wam wehat is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>
<p> So she was considering in her own mind <strong>(as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid)</strong>, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
<p>There was nothing so <em> very </em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em> very </em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on,<mark>Alice</mark> started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>
